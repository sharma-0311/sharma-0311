Project_1 :- **TITANIC_CLASSIFICATION**

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It involves cleaning, exploring, and analyzing the dataset to extract a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
